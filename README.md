A small program I made just for fun. I was trying to learn the basics of raytracing.

It uses a custom math library for vector calculations. You can learn more about it [here](https://github.com/iMaximuz/Vectorian).

I based this code on Casey's muratori ([@cmuratori](https://twitter.com/cmuratori)) [video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAeU3Z0PmcU).
